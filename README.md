Upload: The user uploads an invoice file. The application performs OCR using the Gemini API to convert the document into raw text.

Extract: The raw text is sent back to the Gemini API with a structured schema. The model identifies and extracts key information, line items, and performs an AI-driven summary and verification.

Review: All extracted data is presented in an editable form, allowing the user to make corrections or additions.

Export: The final, verified data can be exported in various formats or used to generate content like a payment reminder email.
